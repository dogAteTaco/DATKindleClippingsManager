# DAT Kindle Clippings Manager
Desktop application where you can visualize and backup the Highlights and Notes from your Kindle.

The application let's you select the location of the "_My Clippings.txt_" file located in your Kindle in the "_documents_" folder (which is where the Kindle stores all your note and highlights) and read them in a more friendly interface.

# Features
- You can load your notes and highlights from your Kindle and they are organized by book.
- Enables you to select or paste an image to so you can easily distinguish from your books.
- Enables you to back up the Clippings from your Kindle and organizes them by date and time.
- Automatically tries to load your Clippings if the location you last used it's available.
- If you already have a location saved for your Kindle "_My Clippings.txt_" file but the device was disconnected when you started the software it detects if you connect an USB device and checks if it's your Kindle.

# Planned features
- Ability to edit the notes and save them directly to your Kindle.
- Ability to remove Highlights and Notes.
- Ability to merge multiple "_My Clippings.txt_" files in case you have multiple Kindle devices and want to manually sync your notes.
- A better way to replace your Book covers (currently you have to manually delete the image and configure it again)

# Notes
The application has been tested with a _Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen_ so if you use it and find any issues feel free to let me know.
